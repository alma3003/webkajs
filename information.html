    <h5 class="char-title">Peri</h5>
    <p class="card-text">The image of the nymph - peri (among other peoples of the Pari) — was preserved by the Tajik, Pamir peoples, Afghans, Persians, Baluchs, and then strengthened in the Turkic-speaking mythology. Benevolent bets appear in mythology in the form of a bird, a beaver or a non-poisonous white or yellow snake, and evil ones appear in the form of poisonous snakes, frogs, turtles, predatory animals, for example, a tiger.
Peris are endowed with different qualities. If in many Turkic-speaking and Iranian-speaking peoples they are perceived as evil spirits, then among the Kazakhs these creatures are considered representatives of a special people.
The Peris are divided into Muslim and Kapirs. There are also water peris - Su peris. They can also be considered beautiful aerial creatures that live between heaven and earth in the mountains of Kaf. Peri girls are very beautiful, young men often fall in love with them.
                    In Kazakh mythology, mermaids are considered one of the types of su peri - water fairies. Usually they tickle their victims to death and only then drag them to the bottom.</p>

      <h3 class="char-category">Mythology</h3>
    <h5 class="char-title">Aidahar</h5>
    <p class="card-text">This is a dragon, which in Kazakh legends appears in the form of a huge snake. The word aidahar comes from the ancient Iranian-Avestan mythical character Dahak. The image of the modern folk dragon is fully formed under the influence of medieval Arab-Persian fairy-epic traditions, that is, it is formed in accordance with their character. They are depicted as one-, three-, seven-headed monsters living in caves and wells. According to the most common plot, he steals a girl, hides her, and then eats her.
Among the Saks in 4-3 thousand BC, aidahar was perceived as the progenitor, the mother of mankind.

In mythology, aidahar personifies the zoomorphic nature of the three worlds — serpentine, underground and aquatic.
The book "Mythology of the Predkazakhs" describes the place and meaning of snakes in Kazakh mythology. The positive cult of the snake was present even in the mythology of the Turks. The Turkic peoples perceived the snake as the keeper of the hearth. The snake that got into the house could not be killed — it was necessary to pour koumiss on her head, thereby escorting her outside.
The perception of Aidahar as the personification of evil came with the advent of Islam on the territory of Kazakhstan.</p>
